## Why does Python give me a `SyntaxError`?

Requires Python 3.5 or above, because I want PEP 448.

## Why doesn't it work on Ubuntu?

Because I don't have time for the FFmpeg vs libAV tiff.

## Why can't it work better with NAT?

I'm sorry, but that's your problem. I already pollute the code with an extra
exchange to give the public address. You didn't expect much from something that
doesn't even do symmetric RTP, right?

## Why isn't there any form of protocol versioning?

Because I haven't made a stable release, and I really don't care to number
trivial experiments.

## Why isn't there feature X?

Because this is for fun, is intended to solve a specific use case, and isn't
mean to replace SIP, Hangouts, or your favourite VoIP protocol or service.
